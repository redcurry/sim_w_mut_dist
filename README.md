Numerical simulation of evolution, given a mutational distribution

Sample run:

  ./simulation $RANDOM mut_dist 1

The first argument is the random seed,
the second is the file with the mutational distribution,
and the third is the replicate number
(i.e., it will be printed with every line of output).
